    <h1>Has My Gem Built Yet?</h1>
    <p>
      This site used to let you know if your <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> gems had finished building...
    </p>
    <p>
      However, times move on, and GitHub have <a href="http://github.com/blog/515-gem-building-is-defunct">discontinued</a> their gem building service, so we're out of a job. These days, you get to build your own gems and distribute them directly through the excellent <a href="http://gemcutter.org">gemcutter</a> instead! Thanks for visiting, and hopefully we will see you again further down the road.

This page is not associated with <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> in any way, apart from thinking that they are awesome (I hope they don't mind me borrowing the image above). Code is available on <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/hasmygembuiltyet">GitHub</a>, of course.
