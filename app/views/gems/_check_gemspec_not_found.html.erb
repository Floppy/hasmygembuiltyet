  Oh dear. We couldn't load the gemspec file from your repository. Are you sure you have
  file called <strong><%=h @project %>.gemspec</strong> in <a href="http://github.com/<%=h @user%>/<%=h @project %>/tree/master/">the repository root directory</a>?
</p>
<p>
  If you don't, you will need one. For an example gemspec file, take a look at
  <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/amee-ruby/tree/master/amee-ruby.gemspec">this example</a>
  from <a href="http://github.com/Floppy/amee-ruby/tree/master/">amee-ruby</a>.
