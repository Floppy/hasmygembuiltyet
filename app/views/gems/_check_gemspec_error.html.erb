  Oh dear. We managed to get the
  <a href="http://github.com/<%=h @user%>/<%=h @project %>/tree/master/<%=h @project %>.gemspec">gemspec file</a>
  from your repository, but it had problems when we tried to load it. It looks like it
  <% if @syntax_error %>
    has syntax errors in it,
  <% else %>
    won't execute in SAFE=3 mode,
  <% end %>
  which means that GitHub can't build it.
</p>
<% unless @syntax_error %>
  <p>
    Common reasons for this error include:
    <ul>
      <li>Using unsafe functions in your file lists.</li>
      <li>Requiring other gems, like rake.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<% end %>
<p>
  To try to fix this locally, run your gemspec through
  <a href="/github-test.rb">GitHub's test script</a>. Once it doesn't raise
  any errors, you should be good to go.
