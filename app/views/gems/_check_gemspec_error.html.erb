  Oh dear. We managed to get the gemspec file from your repository, but it had
  problems when we tried to load it. Either it has syntax errors in it, or it
  won't execute in SAFE=3 mode. Either way, GitHub won't build it.
</p>
<p>
  Common reasons for this error include:
  <ul>
    <li>Using unsafe functions in your file lists.</li>
    <li>Requiring other gems, like rake.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  To try to fix this locally, run your gemspec through
  <a href="/github-test.rb">GitHub's test script</a>. Once it doesn't raise
  any errors, you should be good to go.
